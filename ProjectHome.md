# libntxm #

libntxm ([NitroTracker](http://nitrotracker.tobw.net) [XM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XM_%28file_format%29) library) is a library for playing XM music in [Nintendo DS homebrew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ds_homebrew) software. It's very CPU friendly, because it uses the DS sound hardware directly instead of doing software mixing.
